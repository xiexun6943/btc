Unlike traditional investment products, digital assets typically do not have any underlying or intrinsic asset value or anything to support their price. <br><br>

6.12 Digital asset trading is highly speculative and involves significant risks. There is limited or no underlying reasoning behind digital asset pricing, which may be affected by irrational and uncontrollable market forces.

Therefore, the trading risks of digital assets are borne by the users themselves. <br><br>

Therefore, market conditions can change significantly over a short period of time. Additionally, without interest or development in digital assets, the value of digital assets may never recover. Therefore, users risk losing all or most of the value of their digital assets. This loss can occur within a short period of time. <br><br>

    '保证金、杠杆和杠杆率'=>'Margin, leverage and leverage',

    '6.76 在您被允许与我们订立合约之前，您通常需要向我们存入资金------这称为保证金要求。该保证金要求通常是总合约价值的一部分。这意味着您将使用"杠杆"，这可能对您有利或不利。对您有利的小幅价格变动可能会导致合约保证金要求的高回报，但对您不利的小幅变动可能会导致重大损失。<br><br>

6.77 在您有未平仓的仓位的任何时候，您应确保您的账户余额（考虑到仓位盈亏）至少等于我们要求您向我们存入的总保证金要求。因此，如果我们的价格对您不利，您可能需要立即向我们提供大量额外资金以满足您的保证金要求并维持您未平仓的仓位。如果您未能补仓，我们将有权自行决定平仓您持有的任何数字资产中的一个或多个或所有仓位。您应自行就因此而产生的任何损失负责。<br><br>

6.78 由于杠杆效应的影响，当您与我们订立合约时，监控您的仓位更为重要。杠杆放大了可能产生利润或损失的比率，因此，密切监控您的仓位非常重要。<br><br>

6.79 我们无义务随时通知您您的账户余额和所需保证金（即"追加保证金"）。但是，如果我们进行通知，追加保证金通知可以通过电话、邮寄、电子邮件、短信或通过您的 BTCUSDT 平台进行。<br><br>

6.80 我们有权在任何时候并在短时间内，增加或减少您对未平仓交易的保证金要求。您同意，无论您和我们采用何种正常沟通方式，我们都有权通过以下任何方式通知您账户的保证金水平或信用安排的变化：电话、电子邮件、短信、通过我们的 BTCUSDT 平台上发布变更通知。保证金水平的任何增加都将根据我们的要求立即到期应付。我们只会在我们自行决定合理认为必要时增加保证金要求或变更您账户的信用安排，包括但不限于由于发生或预计发生下列情形：<br><br>

(a) 数字资产市场的波动性和/或流动性发生变化；<br><br>

(b) 经济新闻；<br><br>

(c) 传闻某数字资产在另一数字资产交易平台被暂停交易；<br><br>

(d) 您改变与我们的交易方式；或者<br><br>

(e) 适用法律法规的任何变化。<br><br>

6.81 根据适用法律和法规，对于某些类别的客户，我们可能无法接受通过信用卡或与第三方达成的任何其他信贷安排支付的保证金。<br><br>

6.82 请注意，在某些情况下，我们可能会触发分摊机制，以从您的收益中提取一部分以弥补任何损失。当 BTCUSDT 的风险保险资金无法弥补用户的损失时，会触发分摊机制。在该等情况下，BTCUSDT 将使用其分摊机制从其他用户追回净利润以弥补不足。有关分摊机制的更多信息，请参见此处。<br><br>

6.83 若用户因为网站交易规则中潜在的尚未发现的某种漏洞或平台系统故障或漏洞而产生不当得利，我们将联系用户追回不当得利。您必须予以实际配合，否则我们将采取包括但不限于限制账户交易、冻结账户资金、从您的账户资产中直接扣除因上述漏洞而产生不当得利，向有管辖权的法院起诉等追索措施。因用户不予有效配合而给我们产生的追索费用，也将由用户承担。<br><br>

6.84 在某些情况或情况下，平仓数字资产的仓位可能很困难甚至无法平仓。网络上发生的某些事件可能会迅速发生并影响在 BTCUSDT 平台上进行交易的能力。与这些网络事件相关的信息可能难以事先预测或确定，并且可能受到任何能够干预以稳定网络的第三方的有限监督。'=>'6.76 You will usually be required to deposit funds with us before you are allowed to enter into a contract with us - this is called a margin requirement. This margin requirement is usually a portion of the total contract value. This means you will be using "leverage", which may work to your advantage or disadvantage. Small price changes in your favor can result in high returns on the contracts margin requirements, but small price changes against you can result in significant losses. <br><br>

6.77 At any time you have an open position, you should ensure that your account balance (taking into account the profit and loss of the position) is at least equal to the total margin requirement that we require you to deposit with us. Therefore, if our prices move against you, you may be required to immediately provide us with substantial additional funds to satisfy your margin requirements and maintain your open positions. If you fail to cover your position, we will have the right, at our sole discretion, to close one or more or all positions in any digital assets you hold. You shall be solely responsible for any resulting losses. <br><br>

6.78 Due to the impact of leverage, it is even more important to monitor your positions when you enter into a contract with us. Leverage magnifies the rate at which profits or losses can occur, so its important to monitor your positions closely. <br><br>

6.79 We are under no obligation to notify you of your account balance and required margin (i.e., "Margin Call") at any time. However, if we make a notification, the margin call can be made by phone, post, email, text message or through your BTCUSDT platform. <br><br>

6.80 We reserve the right to increase or decrease your margin requirements for open trades at any time and at short notice. You agree that regardless of the normal method of communication between you and us, we have the right to notify you of changes in the margin level or credit arrangement of your account by any of the following methods: telephone, email, text message, or by posting a change notice on our BTCUSDT platform . Any increase in margin levels will become immediately due and payable at our request. We will only increase margin requirements or change the credit arrangements for your account when we, in our sole discretion, reasonably deem it necessary, including but not limited to due to the occurrence or anticipation of the following circumstances:<br><br>

(a) Changes in the volatility and/or liquidity of digital asset markets;<br><br>

(b) Economic news;<br><br>

(c) It is rumored that a certain digital asset has been suspended from trading on another digital asset trading platform;<br><br>

(d) You change the way you deal with us; or<br><br>

(e) Any changes in applicable laws and regulations. <br><br>

6.81 Subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may not be able to accept deposits paid by credit card or any other credit arrangement with a third party for certain categories of customers. <br><br>

6.82 Please note that in certain circumstances we may trigger a splitting mechanism to take a portion of your earnings to cover any losses. When BTCUSDTs risk insurance funds cannot cover the users losses, the sharing mechanism will be triggered. In such cases, BTCUSDT will use its sharing mechanism to recover net profits from other users to make up for the shortfall. More information on the apportionment mechanism can be found here. <br><br>

6.83 If a user has unjust gains due to a potential undiscovered loophole in the website’s transaction rules or a platform system failure or loophole, we will contact the user to recover the unjust gains. You must actually cooperate, otherwise we will take recourse measures including but not limited to restricting account transactions, freezing account funds, directly deducting unjust gains caused by the above loopholes from your account assets, suing in a court of competent jurisdiction, etc. . The recovery costs incurred by us due to the users failure to effectively cooperate will also be borne by the user. <br><br>

6.84 In certain circumstances or circumstances, closing a position in a digital asset may be difficult or even impossible to close. Certain events that occur on the network may occur rapidly and affect the ability to conduct transactions on the BTCUSDT platform. Information related to these cyber events may be difficult to predict or determine in advance and may be subject to limited oversight by any third party capable of intervening to stabilize the network.

Fourth, Bitcoin is a virtual currency on the Internet, which has certain currency attributes and certain payment attributes in specific Internet communities;<br><br>
